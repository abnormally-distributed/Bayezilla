\description{
This is the horseshoe model described by Carvalho et al. (2010), but with the allowance
for a set of covariates that are not penalized. For example, you may wish to include variables such
as age and gender in all models so that the coefficients for the other variables are penalized while
controlling for these. This is a common need in research. \cr 
\cr
This tends to run very quickly even for larger data sets or larger 
numbers of predictors and in my experience is faster and more stable (at least
on the tested data sets!) than the same model implemetned in Stan. \cr
