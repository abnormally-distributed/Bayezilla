}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{the model formula}

\item{data}{a data frame.}

\item{family}{one of "gaussian", "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{df}{degrees of freedom on the prior thetas}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 5000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 5000.}

\item{adapt}{How many adaptation steps? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 2.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "parallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "rjparallel" or. Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\item{cl}{Use parallel::makeCluster(# clusters) to specify clusters for the parallel methods. Defaults to two cores.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to run.jags.}
}
\value{
A run.jags object

\description{
This is the \strong{I}ndicator variables and \strong{A}daptive Student’s \strong{t}-distributions (IAt)
model discussed by Knürr, Läärä, and Sillanpää (2011). 
\cr
\cr
The prior probability for the inclusion rate ("phi") is given a weakly 
informative beta(1.5, 1.5) prior distribution. The degrees of freedom
for the thetas (raw coefficients) requires user input. 
The default is set to 3. It is doubtful that you would need to change
this. However if there is a large amount of collinearity 
in your data you may want to set it to a higher number such as
12 or 30.
