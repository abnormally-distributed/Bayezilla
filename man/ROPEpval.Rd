\title{Get ROPE p-values}
\usage{
ROPEpval(x, ROPE = c(-0.1, 0.1), keeppars = c("Intercept", "beta"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a stanfit or runjags object.}

\item{ROPE}{A numeric vector of two numbers. Defaults to c(-.1, .1), assuming standardized regression coefficients or Cohen's d... Adjust to what is reasonable!}

\item{keeppars}{The name of the parameters. Can use "beta" to match up with all betas, ie, "beta[1]", "beta[2]", etc. Defaults to c("Intercept", "beta").}
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage of the posterior distribution that lies within the defined ROPE interval. Odds in favor
of the parameter lying within the ROPE are also provided. This utilizes the
full posterior distribution, rather than the percentage of the credible interval that overlaps with the ROPE as in the ROPEtest function.
This is designed to rule out effects that are smaller than a specified magnitude. 


Some guidelines for interpreting the values: \cr
