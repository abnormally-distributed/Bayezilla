SpikeDC(formula, design.formula, data, family = "gaussian",
  log_lik = FALSE, iter = 10000, warmup = 1000, adapt = 2000,
  chains = 4, thin = 1, method = "parallel", cl = makeCluster(2),
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{the model formula.}

\item{design.formula}{formula for the design covariates.}

\item{data}{a data frame.}

\item{family}{one of "gaussian", "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{adapt}{How many adaptation steps? Defaults to 2000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "parallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "rjparallel". Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\item{cl}{Use parallel::makeCluster(# clusters) to specify clusters for the parallel methods. Defaults to two cores.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to run.jags.}
}
\value{

\description{
IMPORTANT NOTICE: This model works best on smaller to medium sized data sets with a small number of variables (less than 20).
If you experience difficulty with running times or obtaining a good effective sample size consider using the extended LASSO.
\cr
\cr
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Center and scale your predictors before using this function.
If you do not scale and center your numeric predictors, this will likely not give reasonable results. 
\cr
This function allows you to use the Bernoulli-Normal mixture model for variable selection while controlling for
a set of covariates that remain constant in all models. For example, you may wish to include variables such as
age and gender across all models such that the variables are selected while controlling for these. This is a common
need in research. \cr
\cr
This is the most basic type of Bayesian variable selection. This is inspired by the method presented by Kuo and Mallick (1998), 
with some improvements. This models the regression coefficients as coming from either a null distribution represented
by a probability mass of 100% at zero (the "spike") or unpenalized. The probability that a coefficient 
comes from the null-spike is controlled by a hyperparameter "phi" which estimates the overall probability of inclusion, 
i.e., the proportion of the P-number of predictors that are non-zero. This hyperparameter is given a Jeffrey's prior, 
beta(1/2, 1/2) which is non-informative and objective. \cr
\cr 
Standard gaussian, binomial, and poisson likelihood functions are available. \cr \cr
