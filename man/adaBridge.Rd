\description{
The Bayesian Bridge model of Mallick & Yi (2018) combined with the Adaptive Bayesian LASSO of Leng, Tran and David Nott (2018). 
Bridge regression allows you to utilize different Lp norms for the shape 
of the prior through the shape parameter kappa of the power exponential distribution (also known as generalized Gaussian). 
Norms of 1 and 2 give the Laplace and Gaussian distributions respectively (corresponding to the LASSO and Ridge Regression). 
Norms smaller than 1 are very difficult to estimate directly, but have very tall modes at zero and very long, cauchy like tails. 
Values greater than 2 become increasingly platykurtic, with the uniform distribution arising as it approaches infinity. \cr 
\cr
The individual lambdas on each parameter defined by a gamma(sh, ra) distribution,
where sh and ra are shape and rate hyperparameters. 
Here sh and ra are given independent gamma(4, 8) and gamma(1, 10) priors respectively. This places the expected
values for the shape and rate parameters at 0.50 and 0.10 respectively, which is consistent with the gamma(0.50, 0.10) prior on lambda
used for most other shrinkage models in this package \cr
\cr
JAGS has no built in power exponential distribution, so the distribution is parameterized as a uniform-gamma mixture just as in Mallick & Yi (2018). 
The parameterization is given below. For generalized linear models plug-in pseudovariances are used. \cr
