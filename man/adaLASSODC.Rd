\description{
The Adaptive Bayesian LASSO of Leng, Tran and David Nott (2018).This function has the further allowance for a set of covariates that are not penalized. 
For example, you may wish to include variables such as age and gender so that  the coefficients for the other variables are 
penalized while controlling for these. This is a common need in research. Basically just the Bayesian LASSO of Park & Casella (2008) but with
individual lambdas on each parameter defined by a gamma(sh, ra) distribution, where sh and ra are shape and rate hyperparameters. 
Here sh and ra are given independent gamma(4, 8) and gamma(1, 5) priors respectively. This places the expected
values for the shape and rate parameters at 0.50 and 0.20 respectively, which is consistent with the gamma(0.25, 0.20) prior on lambda
used for most other shrinkage models with additional design covariates in this package. 
For the binomial and poisson likelihood functions the uniform-gamma scale mixture for the
variant of the Bayesian LASSO is adapted for use here.

see \code{\link[Bayezilla]{negLASSO}} (which is extremely similar) or \code{\link[Bayezilla]{extLASSO}}.
