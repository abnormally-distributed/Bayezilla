\description{
The adaptive powered correlation prior extends the Zellner-Siow Cauchy g-prior by allowing the crossproduct of the 
model matrix to be raised to powers other than -1 (which gives the Fisher information matrix). The power here will 
be referred to as "lambda". A lambda of 0 results in an identity matrix, which results in a ridge-regression like
prior. Positive values of lambda adapt to collinearity by allowing correlated predictors to enter and exit the model 
together. Negative values of lambda on the other hand favor including only one of a set of correlated predictors. 
This can be understood as projecting the information matrix into a new space which leads to a model
similar in function to principal components regression (Krishna et al., 2009). In this implementation full Bayesian
inference is used for lambda, rather than searching via marginal likelihood maximization as Krishna et al. (2009) did. 
The reason for this is twofold. First, full Bayesian inference means the model has to be fit only once instead of
several times over a grid of candidate values for lambda. Second, this avoids any coherency problems such as those
that arise when using fixed-g priors.\cr
\cr
In addition, this function allows for a set of covariates that are held constant across all models.  
For example, you may wish to keep variables such as age and gender constant in order to control for them,
so that the selected variables are chosen in light of the effects of age and gender on the outcome variable. \cr
\cr
The probability that a variable has no effect is 1 - mean(delta_i), where delta_i is an indicator variable that takes on values of 1 for
inclusion and 0 for exclusion. Averaging the number of 1s over the MCMC iterations gives the posterior inclusion probability (pip), hence, 
1-pip gives the posterior exclusion probability. The overall rate of inclusion for all variables is controlled by the hyperparameter 
"phi". Phi is given a beta(1,1) prior which gives uniform probability to the inclusion rate. \cr
\cr
The posterior means of the coefficients give the Bayesian Model Averaged estimates, which are the expected values of each 
parameter averaged over all sampled models (Hoeting et al., 1999). \cr
\cr
The model specification is given below. Note that the model formulae have been adjusted to reflect the fact that JAGS
parameterizes the normal and multivariate normal distributions by their precision, rater than (co)variance. For generalized
linear models plug-in pseudovariances are used.
