\description{
The Bayesian LASSO of Park & Casella (2008).  The Bayesian Lasso is equivalent to using independent double exponential 
(Laplace distribution) priors on the 
coefficients with a scale of sigma / lambda. However, doing this directly results in slow convergence and poor mixing.
The Laplace distribution can be expressed as a scale mixture of normals with an exponential distribution as the scale 
parameter. This is the method that Park & Casella (2008) utilize and the method that is utilized here. The hierarchical 
structure of the prior distribution is given below. \cr
\cr
Note that for the binomial and poisson likelihood functions 
the New Bayesian LASSO is used, which is a re-parameterization of the Bayesian LASSO utilizing a scale mixture of
uniform distributions to obtain the Laplacian priors (Mallick & Yi, 2014). I have found that this variant simply 
samples faster for the binomial and poisson models. Plug-in pseudovariances are used for these.
