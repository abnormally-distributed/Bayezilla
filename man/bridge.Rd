\description{
The Bayesian Bridge model of Mallick & Yi (2018). Bridge regression allows 
you to utilize different Lp norms for the shape of the prior through the shape parameter 
kappa of the power exponential distribution (also known as generalized Gaussian). 
Norms of 1 and 2 give the Laplace and Gaussian distributions respectively (corresponding to 
the LASSO and Ridge Regression). Norms smaller than 1 are very difficult to estimate,
but have very tall modes at zero and very long, cauchy like tails. Values greater than 2 
become increasingly platykurtic, with the uniform distribution arising as it approaches infinity. \cr 
Using kappa = 1 yields the New Bayesian LASSO, which is a re-parameterization of the 
Bayesian LASSO utilizing a scale mixture of uniform distributions to obtain the Laplacian 
priors (Mallick & Yi, 2014).  \cr
\cr
JAGS has no built in power exponential distribution, so the distribution is parameterized 
as a uniform-gamma mixture just as in Mallick & Yi (2018). For generalized linear models 
plug-in pseudovariances are used. \cr
