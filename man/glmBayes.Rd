\arguments{
\item{formula}{the model formula}

\item{data}{a data frame}

\item{family}{one of "gaussian", "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{adapt}{How many adaptation steps? Defaults to 2000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "parallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "rjparallel" or. Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\item{cl}{Use parallel::makeCluster(# clusters) to specify clusters for the parallel methods. Defaults to two cores.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to run.jags.}
}
\value{
A run.jags object

\description{
This model utilizes cauchy priors for the coefficients. The cauchy distribution
is a Student-t distribution with 1 degree of freedom. It has undefined moments, meaning that it has
undefined mean and undefined variance (although it does have a scale). Here the scale is set to a precision
of 0.01, meaning a scale of 10. However, the extremely long tails of the cauchy 
distribution make it extremely uninformative and ideal for use as a weakly informative prior to obtain
unbiased estimates so long as your data are standardized to mean zero and standard deviation of 1. However,
it should still be weakly informative for unstandardized data as well, but it's a good idea to standardize
when using MCMC methods for computational efficiency.

For an alternative prior that also performs very well see \code{\link[Bayezilla]{apcGlm}}, which when
lambda = -1 gives the Zellner-Siow Cauchy g-prior.
