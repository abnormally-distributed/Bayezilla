\arguments{
\item{formula}{the model formula}

\item{data}{a data frame}

\item{family}{one of "gaussian", "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{adapt}{How many adaptation steps? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "parallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "rjparallel" or. Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\value{
A run.jags object

\description{
This model utilizes extremely vague uniform priors on all parameters. 
These are essentially, for practical purposes, improper flat priors. While JAGS 
does not support an improper prior over the whole real line, the coefficients 
have normal(0, 1e-200) priors. A precision of 1e-200 is equivalent to a standard 
deviation of 1e100, or a googol.  No data that would ever be observed would be 
anywhere near this scale, so this can be used  with scaled or unscaled data with 
equal validity, though I still recommend  standardizing because MCMC samplers work 
better with data all on the same scale. The results from this should be equivalent 
to using lm() or glm() in R but with the benefit of being able to make probability 
statements from the marginal posterior ditributions. \cr

Standard gaussian, binomial, and poisson likelihood functions are available. \cr
