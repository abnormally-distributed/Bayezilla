\usage{
groupBLASSO(X, y, idx, family = "gaussian", log_lik = FALSE,
  iter = 10000, warmup = 1000, adapt = 2000, chains = 4,
  thin = 1, method = "parallel", cl = makeCluster(2), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the model matrix. Construct this manually with model.matrix()[,-1]}

\item{y}{the outcome variable}

\item{idx}{the group labels. Should be of length = to ncol(model.matrix()[,-1]) with the group assignments
for each covariate. Please ensure that you start numbering with 1, and not 0.}

\item{family}{one of "gaussian", "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{adapt}{How many adaptation steps? Defaults to 2000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "parallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "rjparallel" or. Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\item{cl}{Use parallel::makeCluster(# clusters) to specify clusters for the parallel methods. Defaults to two cores.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to run.jags.}
}
\value{
a runjags object
}
\description{
Group selection was introduced in the group LASSO by Yuan and Lin (2006) in
the context of the classical "frequentist" LASSO. The concept is adapted here to the Bayesian LASSO 
following the example of Kyung et al. (2010)\cr
\cr
Note that for the binomial and poisson likelihood functions 
the New Bayesian LASSO is adapted for use here, which utilizes a scale mixture of
uniform distributions to obtain the Laplacian priors (Mallick & Yi, 2014). I have found that this parameterization
simply samples faster for the binomial and poisson models, but is logically equivalent to the normal-exponential
mixture parameterization. Plug-in pseudovariances are used for these.
