\usage{
groupEnet(X, y, idx, log_lik = FALSE, iter = 10000, warmup = 1000,
  adapt = 2000, chains = 4, thin = 1, method = "parallel",
  cl = makeCluster(2), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the model matrix. Construct this manually with model.matrix()[,-1]}

\item{y}{the outcome variable}

\item{idx}{the group labels. Should be of length = to ncol(model.matrix()[,-1]) with the group assignments
for each covariate. Please ensure that you start numbering with 1, and not 0.}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{adapt}{How many adaptation steps? Defaults to 2000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "parallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "rjparallel" or. Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\item{cl}{Use parallel::makeCluster(# clusters) to specify clusters for the parallel methods. Defaults to two cores.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to run.jags.}
}
\value{
A run.jags object
}
\description{
The Bayesian elastic net described by Li and Lin (2010) modified for use as a group selection model,
akin to the Group Bayesian LASSO described by Kyung et al. (2010). Group selection is a method
described first by Yuan & Lin (2006) for applying shrinkage penalties to coefficients that have some natural grouping,
such as refelcting dummy variables of a single factor, or coefficients corresponding to related variables (for example, predictors
derived from a single brain region). Note only the Gaussian likelihood is 
provided because the Bayesian elastic net requires conditioning on the error variance, which GLM-families
do not have.
