\description{
Group selection was introduced in the group LASSO by Yuan and Lin (2006) in
the context of the classical "frequentist" LASSO. The concept is adapted here to the extended Bayesian LASSO 
presented by Crispin M. Mutshinda and Mikko J. Sillanpää (2010). 
\cr
The first version of the model is the original specification in Mutshinda and Sillanpää (2010), labeled
"classic" in the options here. This requires you to choose upper limits for the uniform priors on both 
the top-level shrinkage hyperparameter as well as the local shrinkage parameters. These can be tuned through
model comparison if neccessary. 
\cr

\cr
\cr
The second version is the "gamma" prior. This places a gamma(0.5 , 0.001) prior on the
top level shrinkage hyperparameter. The individual shrinkage parameters are still given independent uniform(0, local_u) 
priors just as in the classic version.

\cr
\cr
The author of the extended Bayesian Lasso (Sillanpää, personal communication) confirmed that gamma prior on the top
level shrinkage parameter 
does work well in some settings, which is why I opted to include the "gamma" variant.
\cr
\cr
One really nice feature of the extended Bayesian Lasso is that inclusion probabilities and Bayes Factors for the 
coefficients are easily obtained. The prior inclusion probability is given by 1/local_u, so for example
uniform(0, 2) priors on the shrinkage parameters indicate a 50% prior inclusion
probability. Common in Bayesian variable selection is to use a 20% probability if
dealing with a high dimensional problem, so for this choose local_u = 5. If you have genuine prior
information you can and should use this to guide your choice. If you are unsure, use model comparison
to select which value of u to choose. Inclusion indicators are given by a step function based on the 
marginal individual shrinkage parameter, delta = step(1 - eta). Inlcusion probabilities are then given as the number of
1s that appear in the vector of monte carlo samples out of the total number of iterations. This will appear as
the mean for each inclusion indicator in the summary. \cr
\cr
Bayes Factors for each cofficient can then be manually derived using the formula below (Mutshinda, & Sillanpää, 2010; 2012).
