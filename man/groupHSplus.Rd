\usage{
groupHSplus(X, y, idx, log_lik = FALSE, iter = 4000, warmup = 3000,
  adapt = 3000, chains = 4, thin = 2, method = "rjparallel",
  cl = makeCluster(2), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the model matrix. Construct this manually with model.matrix()[,-1]}

\item{y}{the outcome variable}

\item{idx}{the group labels. Should be of length = to ncol(model.matrix()[,-1]) with the group assignments
for each covariate. Please ensure that you start numbering with 1, and not 0.}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{adapt}{How many adaptation steps? Defaults to 2000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "rjparallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "parallel" or. Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\item{cl}{Use parallel::makeCluster(# clusters) to specify clusters for the parallel methods. Defaults to two cores.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to run.jags.}
}
\value{
an rjags object
}
\description{
This is the horseshoe+ model described by Bhadra et al (2017) adapted to the problem of group selection, and is
akin to the group Bayesian LASSO. The resulting model has three levels of shrinkage: a global shrinkage level, group level shrinkage,
and finally, coefficient level shrinkage. This is probably best applied when there are a rather large number of variables that can
be clustered into groups that themselves have fairly large numbers (at least 5-6 variables each).
