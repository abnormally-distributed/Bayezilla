\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of values for which the histogram is desired.}

\item{breaks}{one of: a vector giving the breakpoints between histogram cells, a function to compute the vector of breakpoints,
a single number giving the number of cells for the histogram, or a character string naming an algorithm to compute the number of cells (see ‘Details’), a function to compute the number of cells. Defaults to "dhist".}

\item{freq}{logical; if TRUE, the histogram graphic is a representation of frequencies, the counts component of the result; if FALSE, probability densities, component density, are plotted (so that the histogram has a total area of one). Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{probability}{an alias for !freq, for S compatibility.}

\item{include.lowest}{logical; if TRUE, an x[i] equal to the breaks value will be included in the first (or last, for right = FALSE) bar. This will be ignored (with a warning) unless breaks is a vector.}

\item{right}{logical; if TRUE, the histogram cells are right-closed (left open) intervals.}

\item{density}{the density of shading lines, in lines per inch. The default value of NULL means that no shading lines are drawn. Non-positive values of density also inhibit the drawing of shading lines.}

\item{angle}{the slope of shading lines, given as an angle in degrees (counter-clockwise).}

\item{col}{a colour to be used to fill the bars. The default is "#71D795CC".}

\item{border}{the color of the border around the bars. The default is to use the standard foreground color.}

\item{main}{these arguments to title have useful defaults here.}

\item{xlim}{the range of x and y values with sensible defaults. Note that xlim is not used to define the histogram (breaks), but only for plotting (when plot = TRUE).}

\item{ylim}{the range of x and y values with sensible defaults. Note that xlim is not used to define the histogram (breaks), but only for plotting (when plot = TRUE).}

\item{xlab}{these arguments to title have useful defaults here.}

\item{ylab}{these arguments to title have useful defaults here.}

\item{axes}{logical. If TRUE (default), axes are draw if the plot is drawn.}

\item{plot}{logical. If TRUE (default), a histogram is plotted, otherwise a list of breaks and counts is returned. In the latter case, a warning is used if (typically graphical) arguments are specified that only apply to the plot = TRUE case.}

\item{labels}{logical or character string. Additionally draw labels on top of bars, if not FALSE; see plot.histogram.}

\item{nclass}{numeric (integer). For S(-PLUS) compatibility only, nclass is equivalent to breaks for a scalar or character argument.}

\item{warn.unused}{logical. If plot = FALSE and warn.unused = TRUE, a warning will be issued when graphical parameters are passed to hist.default().}

\item{rug}{Should a rug be plotted under the histogram? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{rug.col}{The rug color.}

\item{...}{further arguments and graphical parameters passed to plot.histogram and thence to title and axis (if plot = TRUE).}

\details{
The definition of histogram differs by source (with country-specific biases). 
R's default with equi-spaced breaks (also the default) is to plot the counts in the cells defined by breaks. 
Thus the height of a rectangle is proportional to the number of points falling into the cell, as is the area 
provided the breaks are equally-spaced. The modified hist() function included in the Bayezilla package however
utilizes non-equal sized breaks. More details are given below.
If right = TRUE (default), the histogram cells are intervals of the form (a, b], i.e., 
they include their right-hand endpoint,
but not their left one, with the exception of the first cell when include.lowest is TRUE.
For right = FALSE, the intervals are of the form [a, b), and include.lowest means ‘include highest’.
A numerical tolerance of 1e-7 times the median bin size (for more than four bins, otherwise the median is substituted) 
is applied when counting entries on the edges of bins. This is not included in the reported breaks nor in the calculation
of density.  \cr
\cr
Breaks Algorithms: \cr
\cr
The default breaks algorithm is "dhist", which implements the varying binwidth algorithm of Lorraine Denby. 
This algorithm has some notable
advantages from a statistical point of view. Regions of high density have not only taller bins (as is usual) 
but more narrow bins as well. Regions of lower denisty have not only shorter, but wider bins. This makes the 
probability density much more 
immediately obvious, and captures interesting features of heavy tails and skew with greater efficacy. Algorithms
that yield The former oversmooths in regions of high density, and is poor at identifying sharp peaks and multimodality. 
By contrast, the latter variety oversmooths in regions of low density and can mask outliers and the 
heavy tails of more leptokurtotic distributions. For more information, see Denby & Mallows (2009).  
Other options include "scott", "sturges" and "fd" / "Freedman-Diaconis". Case is ignored and partial matching is used.  
Alternatively, a function can be supplied which will compute the
intended number of breaks or the actual breakpoints as a function of x.
