\title{Histogram of Posterior Distribution}
\usage{
plotPost(paramSampleVec, fit = NULL, param = NULL, xlab = NULL,
  col = "blue", ROPE = NULL, cred.level = 0.9, method = "QI",
  CItextPlace = 0.7, type = "irregular", bins = 20,
  showMedian = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{paramSampleVec}{a vector containing the posterior distribution}

\item{fit}{a stanfit or runjags object. This can be used as an alternative to paramSampleVec,
but you must specify which parameter you would like to plot. If using this argument be sure to type
fit = "yourmodel" so that the function knows it is not intended to be a vector.}

\item{param}{the name of the parameter in the stanfit or runjags object you want to plot.}

\item{xlab}{if desired, a custom x-axis label. If supplying a fit object the label will be
the parameter name, but you can override that. If paramSampleVec is supplied without a custom
label here, the x-axis will display the Greek theta symbol by default.}

\item{col}{the color scheme. One of "blue", "green" "red", or "purple".}

\item{ROPE}{If you would like to display a ROPE, enter vector of three numbers, the first being the
comparison value, the second being the lower limit of the ROPE and the third being the upper limit of the ROPE.}

\item{cred.level}{The credibility level. Defaults to 90\% (.90).}

\item{method}{Quantile Intervals "QI" (the default) or highest density intervals "HDI"}

\item{CItextPlace}{Adjust the position of the credible interval text if needed.}

\item{type}{Either "irregular" (default) which uses uneven sized bins proportional to probability density or "equal" for even sized bins.}

\item{bins}{Adjust the number of bins in the histogram. Default is 20.}

\item{showMedian}{Should the median be used instead of the mean?}

\item{...}{other arguments to hist()}

\description{
This is a heavy modification of John Kruchke's function of the same name in the BEST
package. This however makes many aesthetic changes and has some different features from the
original function.
\cr
\cr
A unique feature of this function is that by default irregular sized bins are used. Why? Although
this may appear unsightly to you at first, it actually provides more information. There are two general
classes of histogram binning: equal-width and equal-area histograms. The former oversmooths in
regions of high density, and is poor at identifying sharp peaks and multimodality. 
By contrast, the latter variety
oversmooths in regions of low density and can mask outliers and the heavy tails of more
leptokurtotic distributions (such as the Student-t and Laplacian distributions). The irregular
binned histogram on the other hand lacks these faults, and is better at showing structure of 
the plotted distribution. For plotting posterior distributions I find that this can aid interpretation
of the posterior. Furthermore, regions of high density have not only taller bins (as is usual) but 
more narrow bins as well. Regions of lower denisty have not only shorter, but wider bins. This
makes the probability density much more immediately obvious, and captures interesting features of
heavy tails and skew with greater efficacy. While you can turn off this feature with type = "equal",
I urge you to give the irregular binning method a chance before dismissing it as unaesthetically
appealing. For more information, see Denby & Mallows (2009). \cr
