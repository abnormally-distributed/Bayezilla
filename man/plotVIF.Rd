\usage{
plotVIF(formula, data, family = "gaussian")
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{the formula}

\item{data}{the data}

\item{family}{the glm family. Defaults to "gaussian"}
}
\description{
Calculate the VIF for a least squares or generalized linear model. This is used to
diagnose the ill effects of multicollinearity and collinearity in a regression model. This can 
be helpful in deciding to keep or drop a variable, or more preferably in some cases, use a regularized model.
If the VIFs are all rather low, then using \code{\link[Bayezilla]{glmFlat}} is safe. If some are higher,
you may wish to use \code{\link[Bayezilla]{glmBayes}} instead which results in ridge-regression like 
regularization. \cr
\cr
To use this simply input the formula, data,
and family exactly as you would do with the glm() function. A horizontal dash is marked at 5, indicating
a common point where many argue the variance inflation is problematic. Some have lower conservative (2) 
thresholds and some have higher liberal (10) thresholds, but 5 is one of the more common figures, i.e., 
Sheather (2009).
What this means is that if a variable is inflating the variance of the estimation by a factor of 
5, the standard error of the corresponding coefficient is 2.236068 higher than it would 
be if it were not correlated with other variables.
