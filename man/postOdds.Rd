\title{Get the posterior odds between a point estimator and a null hypothesis}
\usage{
postOdds(fit, param = NULL, H0 = 0, method = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{a runjags or stanfit object. Alternatively, a numeric vector can be provided.}

\item{param}{the name of the parameter to be tested}

\item{H0}{a single value or a vector of values for the null hypothesis. Defaults to zero but this is not appropriate
for a binomial test. Be sure to pick a reasonable null hypothesis.}

\item{method}{whether the mean (default), "median", or a kernel density estimate of the "mode" should be used for the hypothesis test}
}
\description{
Evaluates the density at the null hypothesis vs the density at the estimate, and calculates a
posterior p-value as the percentage of the density at the null hypothesis out of the value of density at the  
point estimate. If the value of the density at the estimate and null are equivalent, then the probability
of the null hypothesis is 1. 

The posterior odds ratio in favor of the null hypothesis is calculated as p / (1 - p).

While similar to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method of calculating Bayes Factors, the posterior odds
ratio evaluates P(H0 | Data) / P(H | Data ), while the Bayes Factor evaluates P(H0 | Data) / P(H0).
That is, the Bayes Factor evaluates the increase in probability relative to the prior, while the posterior odds
is the relative strength of evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. \cr

Guidelines for interpretation are given in a figure below, however, these are intended as rough 
guidelines for interpreting a continuous measure of evidence. The levels of evience given 
below are not intended to be significance thresholds, but rather, "mile-markers".
