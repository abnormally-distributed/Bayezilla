\title{Get the posterior odds between a point estimator and a null hypothesis}
\usage{
postOdds(fit, param = NULL, H0 = 0, method = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{a runjags or stanfit object}

\item{param}{the name of the parameter to be tested}

\item{H0}{a single value or a vector of values for the null hypothesis. Defaults to zero but this is not appropriate
for a binomial test. Be sure to pick a reasonable null hypothesis.}

\item{method}{whether the mean (default), "median", or a kernel density estimate of the "mode" should be used for the hypothesis test}
}
\description{
Evaluates the density at the null hypothesis vs the density at the estimate, and calculates the
posterior odds as P(H0 | Data) / P(theta_hat | Data). This function is not an estimate of the Bayes
Factor. The Savage-Dickey Density Ratio Bayes Factors evaluate P(H0 | Data) / P(H0) 
and characterize the change in probability between the null hypothesis in the prior and posterior. 
Rather, this characterizes the relative posterior probabilities between a null hypothesis and a chosen
point estimate and is not reliant on the prior distribution. \cr
\cr
Smaller values indicate greater evidence against the null. The maximum odds in favor of the null is 1, because
if the estimate is the same value as the null hypothesis, the density ratio will consist of density / density = 1.
This function also returns a "posterior p-value" which is the density ratio (odds) converted
to a probability through the formula p = odds / (1 + odds), which gives the probability
of an error if one rejects the point estimate. Hence, if the estimate is at zero and the
null hypothesis is also zero, the density ratio = 1, so the p-value here
would be 1 / 2 = 0.50. 

Guidelines for interpretation are given in a figure below, however, these are intended as rough 
guidelines for interpreting a continuous measure of evidence. The levels of evience given 
below are not intended to be significance thresholds, but rather, "mile-markers".
