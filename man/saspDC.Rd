\arguments{

\item{data}{a data frame.}

\item{family}{one of "gaussian", "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\description{
The shape adaptive shrinkage prior of Sillanpää &  Mutshinda (2011). This is essentially bridge regression, but with a
shape parameter describing the Lp norm that is allowed to vary rather than stay fixed at a single value. The generalized gaussian 
prior is parameterized in the manner of Mallick, H. & Yi (2018) rather than the method originally described in Sillanpää &  Mutshinda (2011).
Analytically, this makes no difference, but computationally, it is much faster and more stable. This function has the further allowance for a set of covariates that are not penalized. 
For example, you may wish to include variables such as age and gender so that  the coefficients for the other variables are 
penalized while controlling for these. This is a common need in research.
