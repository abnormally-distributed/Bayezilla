\arguments{
\item{formula}{the model formula}

\item{data}{a data frame}

\item{robfun}{"huber" for Huber's Psi, "tukey" for Tukey's Bisquare, or "hampel" for Hampel's Psi (the default).}

\item{c}{the tuning constant for the Huber weights function. Defaults to 1.345, which gives 95\% the efficiency of OLS when there are no outliers.}

\item{t}{the tuning constant for the Tukey's bisquare weights function. Defaults to 4.685, which gives 95\% the efficiency of OLS when there are no outliers.}

\item{k}{the tuning constant controlling the asymptotic relative efficiency of Hampel's psi. The default is 0.9016085, which gives 95\% the efficiency of OLS when there are no outliers.}

\item{log_lik}{Should the log likelihood be monitored? The default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{How many post-warmup samples? Defaults to 10000.}

\item{warmup}{How many warmup samples? Defaults to 1000.}

\item{chains}{How many chains? Defaults to 4.}

\item{thin}{Thinning interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{method}{Defaults to "rjparallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "parallel". Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\item{cl}{Use parallel::makeCluster(# clusters) to specify clusters for the parallel methods. Defaults to two cores.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to run.jags.}

\item{formula}{the model formula}

\item{data}{a data frame}

\item{family}{one of "gaussian", "st" (Student-t with nu = 3), "binomial", or "poisson".}

\item{method}{Defaults to "parallel". For an alternative parallel option, choose "rjparallel". Otherwise, "rjags" (single core run).}

\value{
A run.jags object.

\description{
The same model as the \code{\link[Bayezilla]{zsGlm}} Gaussian model, but with the likelihood
function replaced by a "contaminated normal" model which consists of a convolution
of two Gaussians with the same mean but different variances. The Gaussian with the lower variance models the 
"uncontaminated" data while the Gaussian with the higher variance models the "contaminated"
portion of the data. Tukey, 1960; Box & Tiao, 1968; Gleason, 1993). The mixture proportions are obtained using either  Huber's
Psi, Hampel's Psi, or Tukey's Bisquare functions to generate weights. Information about the weight functions
is given in the figure below. (Huber, 1964; Hampel et al., 1986; Hoaglin, Mosteller, & Tukey, 1983) 

The Fisher information matrix used as part of the g-prior (see the documentation in the \code{\link[Bayezilla]{zsGlm}}
function for more information) is calculated here using a minimum volume ellipsoid method to obtain a robust
covariance matrix, which is subjected to eigendecomposition and reconstructed as an inverse using the formula
L * D^-1 * L'. The matrix is then scaled according to the ratio of the trace of the non-robust Fisher information matrix
to the robust matrix. Note this particular model is meant to be an empirical Bayes or frequentist method estimated using
full Bayesian 'machinery' as a means to an end, and not so much a fully Bayesian model as most other functions in this
package.
